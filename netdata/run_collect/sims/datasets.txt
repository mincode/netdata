Data sets:
All data sets cover 120 seconds, down to smallest resolution of 1 second.
Each client sends a message at most every second.

Data set: s1c1_s1c1
2 clusters
Cluster 0: 1 server, 1 client
  Emit probability of the client: 0.5
  The client only sends to the server in its cluster.
Cluster 1: 1 server, 1 client
  Emit probability of the client: 0.5
  The client sends to Cluster 0 with probability 0.1 and 
  to its own cluster with probability 0.9. 

Data set: clusters2
2 clusters
Cluster 0: 1 server, 1 client
  Emit probability of the client: 0.5
  The client sends to its own cluster with probability 0.9 and 
  to Cluster 1 with probability 0.1. 
Cluster 1: 1 server, 1 client
  Emit probability of the client: 0.5
  The client sends to Cluster 0 with probability 0.1 and 
  to its own cluster with probability 0.9.

2 clusters
Cluster 0: 1 server, 1 client
  Emit probability of the client: 0.5
  The client sends to its own cluster with probability 0.98 and 
  to Cluster 1 with probability 0.02. 
Cluster 1: 1 server, 1 client
  Emit probability of the client: 0.5
  The client sends to Cluster 0 with probability 0.02 and 
  to its own cluster with probability 0.98. 

Data set: cl2
2 clusters
Cluster 0: 1 server, 2 clients
  Emit probability of any client: 0.33
  Any client sends to its own cluster with probability 0.9 and 
  to Cluster 1 with probability 0.1. 
  Since there are two clients, they may send simultaneously. 
Cluster 1: 1 server, 2 clients
  Emit probability of any client: 0.33
  Any client sends to Cluster 0 with probability 0.1 and 
  to its own cluster with probability 0.9. 
  Since there are two clients, they may send simultaneously.

  to Cluster 1 with probability 0.02. 
  Since there are two clients, they may send simultaneously. 
Cluster 1: 1 server, 2 clients
  Emit probability of any client: 0.33
  Any client sends to Cluster 0 with probability 0.02 and 
  to its own cluster with probability 0.98. 
  Since there are two clients, they may send simultaneously.
